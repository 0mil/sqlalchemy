-- temporary notes --


- make sure input() function in dogpile example works in py2
- we want to get rid of any support for sets.Set entirely; check to see what
impact this has.   in langhelpers as well as in collections.py
- give raise_from_cause some more manual tests:
	 - schema.py has one
	 - engine/strategies.py on connect
	 - sql/compiler.py for column errors in create table
