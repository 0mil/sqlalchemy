    Fixed bug in :meth:`.Session.merge` where objects in a collection that had
    the primary key attribute set to ``None`` for a key that is  typically
    autoincrementing would be considered to be a database-persisted key for
    part of the internal deduplication process, causing only one object to
    actually be inserted in the database.
