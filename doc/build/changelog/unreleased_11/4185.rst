    :versions: 1.2.3

    Fixed regression caused by fix for issue :ticket:`4116` affecting versions
    1.2.2 as well as 1.1.15, which had the effect of mis-calculation of the
    "owning class" of an :class:`.AssociationProxy` as the ``NoneType`` class
    in some declarative mixin/inheritance situations as well as if the
    association proxy were accessed off of an un-mapped class.  The "figure out
    the owner" logic has been replaced by an in-depth routine that searches
    through the complete mapper hierarchy assigned to the class or subclass to
    determine the correct (we hope) match; will not assign the owner if no
    match is found.  An exception is now raised if the proxy is used
    against an un-mapped instance.
