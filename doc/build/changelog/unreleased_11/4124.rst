    Fixed bug where a descriptor that is elsewhere a mapped column
    or relationship within a hierarchy based on :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase`
    would be referred towards during a refresh operation, causing an error
    as the attribute is not mapped as a mapper property.
    A similar issue can arise for other attributes like the "type" column
    added by :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase` if the class fails to include
    "concrete=True" in its mapper, however the check here should also
    prevent that scenario from causing a problem.
