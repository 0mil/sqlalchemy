    Fixed race condition in ORM identity map which would cause objects
    to be inappropriately removed during a load operation, causing
    duplicate object identities to occur, particularly under joined eager
    loading which involves deduplication of objects.  The issue is specific
    to garbage collection of weak references and is observed only under the
    Pypy interpreter.
