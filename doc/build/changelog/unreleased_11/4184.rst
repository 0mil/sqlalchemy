    Fixed a fairly serious connection pool bug where a connection that is
    acquired after being refreshed as a result of a user-defined
    :class:`.DisconnectionError` or due to the 1.2-released "pre_ping" feature
    would not be correctly reset if the connection were returned to the pool by
    weakref cleanup (e.g. the front-facing object is garbage collected); the
    weakref would still refer to the previously invalidated DBAPI connection
    which would have the reset operation erroneously called upon it instead.
    This would lead to stack traces in the logs and a connection being checked
    into the pool without being reset, which can cause locking issues.
