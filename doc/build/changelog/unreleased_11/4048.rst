    Fixed bug where an :func:`.undefer_group` option would not be recognized
    if it extended from a relationship that was loading using joined eager
    loading.  Additionally, as the bug led to excess work being performed,
    Python function call counts are also improved by 20% within the initial
    calculation of result set columns, complementing the joined eager load
    improvements of :ticket:`3915`.
