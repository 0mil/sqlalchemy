	Fixed performance regression caused by the fix for :ticket:`3937` where
	cx_Oracle as of version 5.3 dropped the ``.UNICODE`` symbol from its
	namespace,  which was interpreted as cx_Oracle's "WITH_UNICODE" mode being
	turned on unconditionally, which invokes functions on the SQLAlchemy
	side which convert all strings to unicode unconditionally and causing
	a performance impact.  In fact, per cx_Oracle's author the
	"WITH_UNICODE" mode has been removed entirely as of 5.1, so the expensive unicode
	conversion functions are no longer necessary and are disabled if
	cx_Oracle 5.1 or greater is detected under Python 2.  The warning against
	"WITH_UNICODE" mode that was removed under :ticket:`3937` is also restored.
