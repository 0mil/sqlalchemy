    Support for two-phase transactions has been removed entirely for
    cx_Oracle when version 6.0b1 or later of the DBAPI is in use.  The two-
    phase feature historically has never been usable under cx_Oracle 5.x in
    any case, and cx_Oracle 6.x has removed the connection-level "twophase"
    flag upon which this feature relied.
