        :tickets: 3117

        The "evaulator" for query.update()/delete() won't work with multi-table
        updates, and needs to be set to `synchronize_session=False` or
        `synchronize_session='fetch'`; this now raises an exception, with a
        message to change the synchronize setting.
        This is upgraded from a warning emitted as of 0.9.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: removed

        The Drizzle dialect has been removed from the Core; it is now
        available as `sqlalchemy-drizzle <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy-drizzle>`_,
        an independent, third party dialect.  The dialect is still based
        almost entirely off of the MySQL dialect present in SQLAlchemy.

        :tickets: 3061

        Adjustment to attribute mechanics concerning when a value is
        implicitly initialized to None via first access; this action,
        which has always resulted in a population of the attribute,
        no longer does so; the None value is returned but the underlying
        attribute receives no set event.  This is consistent with how collections
        work and allows attribute mechanics to behave more consistently;
        in particular, getting an attribute with no value does not squash
        the event that should proceed if the value is actually set to None.

	.. change::
		:tags: feature, sql
		:tickets: 3034

		The :meth:`.Select.limit` and :meth:`.Select.offset` methods
		now accept any SQL expression, in addition to integer values, as
		arguments.  Typically this is used to allow a bound parameter to be
		passed, which can be substituted with a value later thus allowing
		Python-side caching of the SQL query.   The implementation
		here is fully backwards compatible with existing third party dialects,
		however those dialects which implement special LIMIT/OFFSET systems
		will need modification in order to take advantage of the new
		capabilities.  Work on this feature is courtesy of Dobes Vandermeer.
