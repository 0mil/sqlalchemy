	:version: 1.0.0

    Version 1.0.0 is the first release of the 1.0 series.   Many changes
    described here are also present in the 0.9 and sometimes the 0.8
    series as well.  For changes that are specific to 1.0 with an emphasis
    on compatibility concerns, see :doc:`/changelog/migration_10`.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 3171

        The "resurrect" ORM event has been removed.  This event hook had
        no purpose since the old "mutable attribute" system was removed
        in 0.8.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 3169

        Using :meth:`.Insert.from_select`  now implies ``inline=True``
        on :func:`.insert`.  This helps to fix a bug where an
        INSERT...FROM SELECT construct would inadvertently be compiled
        as "implicit returning" on supporting backends, which would
        cause breakage in the case of an INSERT that inserts zero rows
        (as implicit returning expects a row), as well as arbitrary
        return data in the case of an INSERT that inserts multiple
        rows (e.g. only the first row of many).
        A similar change is also applied to an INSERT..VALUES
        with multiple parameter sets; implicit RETURNING will no longer emit
        for this statement either.  As both of these constructs deal
        with varible numbers of rows, the
        :attr:`.ResultProxy.inserted_primary_key` accessor does not
        apply.   Previously, there was a documentation note that one
        may prefer ``inline=True`` with INSERT..FROM SELECT as some databases
        don't support returning and therefore can't do "implicit" returning,
        but there's no reason an INSERT...FROM SELECT needs implicit returning
        in any case.   Regular explicit :meth:`.Insert.returning` should
        be used to return variable numbers of result rows if inserted
        data is needed.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 3167

        Fixed bug where attribute "set" events or columns with
        ``@validates`` would have events triggered within the flush process,
        when those columns were the targets of a "fetch and populate"
        operation, such as an autoincremented primary key, a Python side
        default, or a server-side default "eagerly" fetched via RETURNING.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql
        :tickets: 2051

        Added support for PG table options TABLESPACE, ON COMMIT,
        WITH(OUT) OIDS, and INHERITS, when rendering DDL via
        the :class:`.Table` construct.   Pull request courtesy
        malikdiarra.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, py3k

        The :class:`.IdentityMap` exposed from :class:`.Session.identity`
        now returns lists for ``items()`` and ``values()`` in Py3K.
        Early porting to Py3K here had these returning iterators, when
        they technically should be "iterable views"..for now, lists are OK.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature

        UPDATE statements can now be batched within an ORM flush
        into more performant executemany() call, similarly to how INSERT
        statements can be batched; this will be invoked within flush
        to the degree that subsequent UPDATE statements for the
        same mapping and table involve the identical columns within the
        VALUES clause, that no SET-level SQL expressions
        are embedded, and that the versioning requirements for the mapping
        are compatible with the backend dialect's ability to return
        a correct rowcount for an executemany operation.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine, bug
        :tickets: 3163

        Removing (or adding) an event listener at the same time that the event
        is being run itself, either from inside the listener or from a
        concurrent thread, now raises a RuntimeError, as the collection used is
        now an instance of ``colletions.deque()`` and does not support changes
        while being iterated.  Previously, a plain Python list was used where
        removal from inside the event itself would produce silent failures.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2963

        The ``info`` parameter has been added to the constructor for
        :class:`.SynonymProperty` and :class:`.ComparableProperty`.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, feature
        :tickets: 2963

        The ``info`` parameter has been added as a constructor argument
        to all schema constructs including :class:`.MetaData`,
        :class:`.Index`, :class:`.ForeignKey`, :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint`,
        :class:`.UniqueConstraint`, :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint`,
        :class:`.CheckConstraint`.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2971

        The :meth:`.InspectionAttr.info` collection is now moved down to
        :class:`.InspectionAttr`, where in addition to being available
        on all :class:`.MapperProperty` objects, it is also now available
        on hybrid properties, association proxies, when accessed via
        :attr:`.Mapper.all_orm_descriptors`.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, feature
        :tickets: 3027
        :pullrequest: bitbucket:29

        The :paramref:`.Table.autoload_with` flag now implies that
        :paramref:`.Table.autoload` should be ``True``.  Pull request
        courtesy Malik Diarra.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql, feature
        :pullreq: github:126

        Added new method :meth:`.PGInspector.get_enums`, when using the
        inspector for Postgresql will provide a list of ENUM types.
        Pull request courtesy Ilya Pekelny.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql, bug

        The MySQL dialect will now disable :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.handle_error`
        events from firing for those statements which it uses internally
        to detect if a table exists or not.   This is achieved using an
        execution option ``skip_user_error_events`` that disables the handle
        error event for the scope of that execution.   In this way, user code
        that rewrites exceptions doesn't need to worry about the MySQL
        dialect or other dialects that occasionally need to catch
        SQLAlchemy specific exceptions.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql, bug
        :tickets: 2515

        Changed the default value of "raise_on_warnings" to False for
        MySQLconnector.  This was set at True for some reason.  The "buffered"
        flag unfortunately must stay at True as MySQLconnector does not allow
        a cursor to be closed unless all results are fully fetched.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 3117

        The "evaulator" for query.update()/delete() won't work with multi-table
        updates, and needs to be set to `synchronize_session=False` or
        `synchronize_session='fetch'`; this now raises an exception, with a
        message to change the synchronize setting.
        This is upgraded from a warning emitted as of 0.9.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: removed

        The Drizzle dialect has been removed from the Core; it is now
        available as `sqlalchemy-drizzle <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy-drizzle>`_,
        an independent, third party dialect.  The dialect is still based
        almost entirely off of the MySQL dialect present in SQLAlchemy.

    .. change::
        :tags: enhancement, orm
        :tickets: 3061

        Adjustment to attribute mechanics concerning when a value is
        implicitly initialized to None via first access; this action,
        which has always resulted in a population of the attribute,
        no longer does so; the None value is returned but the underlying
        attribute receives no set event.  This is consistent with how collections
        work and allows attribute mechanics to behave more consistently;
        in particular, getting an attribute with no value does not squash
        the event that should proceed if the value is actually set to None.

	.. change::
		:tags: feature, sql
		:tickets: 3034

		The :meth:`.Select.limit` and :meth:`.Select.offset` methods
		now accept any SQL expression, in addition to integer values, as
		arguments.  Typically this is used to allow a bound parameter to be
		passed, which can be substituted with a value later thus allowing
		Python-side caching of the SQL query.   The implementation
		here is fully backwards compatible with existing third party dialects,
		however those dialects which implement special LIMIT/OFFSET systems
		will need modification in order to take advantage of the new
		capabilities.  Work on this feature is courtesy of Dobes Vandermeer.
