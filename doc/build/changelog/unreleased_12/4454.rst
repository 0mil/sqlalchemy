   Fixed issue where when using single-table inheritance in conjunction with a
   joined inheritance hierarchy that uses "with polymorphic" loading, the
   "single table criteria" for that single-table entity could get confused for
   that of other entities from the same hierarchy used in the same query.The
   adaption of the "single table criteria" is made more specific to the target
   entity to avoid it accidentally getting adapted to other tables in the
   query.
