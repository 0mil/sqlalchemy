    Fixed the pymssql dialect so that percent signs in SQL text, such
    as used in modulus expressions or literal textual values, are
    **not** doubled up, as seems to be what pymssql expects.  This is
    despite the fact that the pymssql DBAPI uses the "pyformat" parameter
    style which itself considers the percent sign to be significant.
