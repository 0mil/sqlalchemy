    Fixed more regressions caused by cx_Oracle 6.0; at the moment, the only
    behavioral change for users is disconnect detection now detects for
    cx_Oracle.DatabaseError in addition to cx_Oracle.InterfaceError, as
    this behavior seems to have changed.   Other issues regarding numeric
    precision and uncloseable connections are pending with the upstream
    cx_Oracle issue tracker.
