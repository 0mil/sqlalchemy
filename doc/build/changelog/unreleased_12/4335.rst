   Fixed issue for cx_Oracle 7.0 where the behavior of Oracle param.getvalue()
   now returns a list, rather than a single scalar value, breaking
   autoincrement logic throughout the Core and ORM. The dml_ret_array_val
   compatibility flag is used for cx_Oracle 6.3 and 6.4 to establish compatible
   behavior with 7.0 and forward, for cx_Oracle 6.2.1 and prior a version
   number check falls back to the old logic.
