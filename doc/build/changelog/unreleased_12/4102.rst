    In release 1.1, the :class:`.Boolean` type was broken in that
    boolean coercion via ``bool()`` would occur for backends that did not
    feature "native boolean", but would not occur for native boolean backends,
    meaning the string ``"0"`` now behaved inconsistently. After a poll, a
    consensus was reached that non-boolean values should be raising an error,
    especially in the ambiguous case of string ``"0"``; so the :class:`.Boolean`
    datatype will now raise ``ValueError`` if an incoming value is not
    within the range ``None, True, False, 1, 0``.
