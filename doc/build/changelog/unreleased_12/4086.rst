    :tags: feature, mssql
    :tickets: 4086

    Added a new :class:`.mssql.TIMESTAMP` datatype, that
    correctly acts like a binary datatype for SQL Server
    rather than a datetime type, as SQL Server breaks the
    SQL standard here.  Also added :class:`.mssql.ROWVERSION`,
    as the "TIMESTAMP" type in SQL Server is deprecated in
    favor of ROWVERSION.
