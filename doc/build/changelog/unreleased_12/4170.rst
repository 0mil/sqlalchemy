    The :class:`.URL` object now allows query keys to be specified multiple
    times where their values will be joined into a list.  This is to support
    the plugins feature documented at :class:`.CreateEnginePlugin` which
    documents that "plugin" can be passed multiple times. Additionally, the
    plugin names can be passed to :func:`.create_engine` outside of the URL
    using the new :paramref:`.create_engine.plugins` parameter.
