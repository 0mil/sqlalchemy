    Fixed regression in association proxy due to :ticket:`3769`
    (allow for chained any() / has()) where contains() against
    an association proxy chained in the form
    (o2m relationship, associationproxy(m2o relationship, m2o relationship))
    would raise an error regarding the re-application of contains()
    on the final link of the chain.
