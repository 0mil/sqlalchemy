    :tickets: 4063

    Refined the behavior of :meth:`.Operators.op` such that in all cases,
    if the :paramref:`.Operators.op.is_comparison` flag is set to True,
    the return type of the resulting expression will be
    :class:`.Boolean`, and if the flag is False, the return type of the
    resulting expression will be the same type as that of the left-hand
    expression, which is the typical default behavior of other operators.
    Also added a new parameter :paramref:`.Operators.op.return_type` as well
    as a helper method :meth:`.Operators.bool_op`.
