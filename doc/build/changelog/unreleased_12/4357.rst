   Fixed bug in :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings` where alternate mapped
   attribute names would result in the primary key column of the UPDATE
   statement being included in the SET clause, as well as the WHERE clause;
   while usually harmless, for SQL Server this can raise an error due to the
   IDENTITY column.  This is a continuation of the same bug that was fixed in
   :ticket:`.3849`, where testing was insufficient to catch this additional
   flaw.
