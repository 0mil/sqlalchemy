    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4344` released in 1.2.13, where the fix
    for MySQL 8.0's case sensitivity problem with referenced column names when
    reflecting foreign key referents is worked around using the
    ``information_schema.columns`` view.  The workaround was failing on OSX /
    ``lower_case_table_names=2`` which produces non-matching casing for the
    ``information_schema.columns`` vs. that of ``SHOW CREATE TABLE``, so in
    case-insensitive SQL modes case-insensitive matching is now used.
