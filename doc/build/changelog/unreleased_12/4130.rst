    Fixed bug in :func:`.contains_eager` query option where making use of a
    path that used :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type` to refer to a subclass
    across more than one level of joins would also require that the "alias"
    argument were provided with the same subtype in order to avoid adding
    unwanted FROM clauses to the query; additionally,  using
    :func:`.contains_eager` across subclasses that use :func:`.aliased` objects
    of subclasses as the :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type` argument will also
    render correctly.
