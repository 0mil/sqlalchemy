    A warning is emitted if a subclass attempts to override an attribute
    that was declared on a superclass using ``@declared_attr.cascading``
    that the overridden attribute will be ignored. This use
    case cannot be fully supported down to further subclasses without more
    complex development efforts, so for consistency the "cascading" is
    honored all the way down regardless of overriding attributes.

    A warning is emitted if the ``@declared_attr.cascading`` attribute is
    used with a special declarative name such as ``__tablename__``, as this
    has no effect.
