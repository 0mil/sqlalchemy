    Fixed regression introduced in 1.2.0b1 due to :ticket:`3934` where the
    :class:`.Session` would fail to "deactivate" the transaction, if a
    rollback failed (the target issue is when MySQL loses track of a SAVEPOINT).
    This would cause a subsequent call to :meth:`.Session.rollback` to raise
    an error a second time, rather than completing and bringing the
    :class:`.Session` back to ACTIVE.
