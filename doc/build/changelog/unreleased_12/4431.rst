   Reflection of an index based on SQL expressions are now skipped with a
   warning, in the same way as that of the Postgresql dialect, where we currently
   do not support reflecting indexes that have SQL expressions within them.
   Previously, an index with columns of None were produced which would break
   tools like Alembic.
