    Fixed INSERT FROM SELECT with CTEs for the Oracle and MySQL dialects, where
    the CTE was being placed above the entire statement as is typical with
    other databases, however Oracle and MariaDB 10.2 wants the CTE underneath
    the "INSERT" segment. Note that the Oracle and MySQL dialects don't yet
    work when a CTE is applied to a subquery inside of an UPDATE or DELETE
    statement, as the CTE is still applied to the top rather than inside the
    subquery.
