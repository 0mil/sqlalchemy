    Fixed regression where pickle format of a Load / _UnboundLoad object (e.g.
    loader options) changed and ``__setstate__()`` was raising an
    UnboundLocalError for an object received from the legacy format, even
    though an attempt was made to do so.  tests are now added to ensure this
    works.
