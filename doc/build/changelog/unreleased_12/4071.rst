	Removed the warnings that are emitted when the LRU caches employed
	by the mapper as well as loader srtategies reach their threshold; the
	purpose of this warning was at first a guard against excess cache keys
	being generated but became basically a check on the "creating many
	engines" antipattern.   While this is still an antipattern, the presense
	of test suites which both create an engine per test as well as raise
	on all warnings will be an inconvenience; it should not be critical
	that such test suites change their architecture just for this warning
	(though engine-per-test suite is always better).
