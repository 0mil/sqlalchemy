    Fixed bug where the pg8000 driver would fail if using
    :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` with a schema name, since the schema name would
    be sent as a "quoted_name" object that's a string subclass, which pg8000
    doesn't recognize.   The quoted_name type is added to pg8000's
    py_types collection on connect.
