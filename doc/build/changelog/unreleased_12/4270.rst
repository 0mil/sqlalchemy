    Fixed an issue that was both a performance regression in 1.2 as well as an
    incorrect result regarding the "baked" lazy loader, involving the
    generation of cache keys from the original :class:`.Query` object's loader
    options.  If the loader options were built up in a "branched" style using
    common base elements for multiple options, the same options would be
    rendered into the cache key repeatedly, causing both a performance issue as
    well as generating the wrong cache key.  This is fixed, along with a
    performance improvement when such "branched" options are applied via
    :meth:`.Query.options` to prevent the same option objects from being
    applied repeatedly.
