    The :meth:`.Query.exists` method will now disable eager loaders for when
    the query is rendered.  Previously, joined-eager load joins would be rendered
    unnecessarily as well as subquery eager load queries would be needlessly
    generated.   The new behavior matches that of the :meth:`.Query.subquery`
    method.
