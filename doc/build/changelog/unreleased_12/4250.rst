    Fixed a 1.2 regression caused by :ticket:`4061` where the SQL Server
    "BIT" type would be considered to be "native boolean".  The goal here
    was to avoid creating a CHECK constraint on the column, however the bigger
    issue is that the BIT value does not behave like a true/false constant
    and cannot be interpreted as a standalone expression, e.g.
    "WHERE <column>".   The SQL Server dialect now goes back to being
    non-native boolean, but with an extra flag that still avoids creating
    the CHECK constraint.
