   Fixed regression in integer precision logic due to the refactor of the
   cx_Oracle dialect in 1.2.  We now no longer apply the cx_Oracle.NATIVE_INT
   type to result columns sending integer values (detected as positive
   precision with scale ==0) which encounters integer overflow issues with
   values that go beyond the 32 bit boundary.  Instead, the output variable
   is left untyped so that cx_Oracle can choose the best option.
