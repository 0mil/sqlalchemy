    Fixed the :func:`.postgresql.array_agg` function, which is a slightly
    altered version of the usual :func:`.functions.array_agg` function, to also
    accept an incoming "type" argument without forcing an ARRAY around it,
    essentially the same thing that was fixed for the generic function in 1.1
    in :ticket:`4107`.
