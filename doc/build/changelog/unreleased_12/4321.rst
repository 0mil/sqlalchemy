    Fixed issue in previously untested use case, allowing a declarative mapped
    class to inherit from a classically-mapped class outside of the declarative
    base, including that it accommodates for unmapped intermediate classes. An
    unmapped intermediate class may specify ``__abstract__``, which is now
    interpreted correctly, or the intermediate class can remain unmarked, and
    the classically mapped base class will be detected within the hierarchy
    regardless. In order to anticipate existing scenarios which may be mixing
    in classical mappings into existing declarative hierarchies, an error is
    now raised if multiple mapped bases are detected for a given class.
