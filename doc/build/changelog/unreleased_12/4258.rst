    Updated the dogpile.caching example to include new structures that
    accommodate for the "baked" query system, which is used by default within
    lazy loaders and some eager relationship loaders. The dogpile.caching
    "relationship_caching" and "advanced" examples were also broken due to
    :ticket:`4256`.  The issue here is also worked-around by the fix in
    :ticket:`4128`.
