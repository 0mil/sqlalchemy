    Changed the "visit name" of :class:`.ColumnElement` from "column" to
    "column_element", so that when this element is used as the basis for a
    user-defined SQL element, it is not assumed to behave like a table-bound
    :class:`.ColumnClause` when processed by various SQL traversal utilities,
    as are commonly used by the ORM.
