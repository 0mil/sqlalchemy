    Added a new event currently used only by the cx_Oracle dialect,
    :meth:`.DialectEvents.setiputsizes`.  The event passes a dictionary of
    :class:`.BindParameter` objects to DBAPI-specific type objects that will be
    passed, after conversion to parameter names, to the cx_Oracle
    ``cursor.setinputsizes()`` method.  This allows both visibility into the
    setinputsizes process as well as the ability to alter the behavior of what
    datatypes are passed to this method.
