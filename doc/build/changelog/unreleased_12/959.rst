    Implemented "DELETE..FROM" syntax for Postgresql, MySQL, MS SQL Server
    (as well as within the unsupported Sybase dialect) in a manner similar
    to how "UPDATE..FROM" works.  A DELETE statement that refers to more than
    one table will switch into "multi-table" mode and render the appropriate
    "USING" or multi-table "FROM" clause as understood by the database.
