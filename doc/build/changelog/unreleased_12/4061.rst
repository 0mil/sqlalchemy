    SQL Server supports what SQLAlchemy calls "native boolean"
    with its BIT type, as this type only accepts 0 or 1 and the
    DBAPIs return its value as True/False.   So the SQL Server
    dialects now enable "native boolean" support, in that a
    CHECK constraint is not generated for a :class:`.Boolean`
    datatype.  The only difference vs. other native boolean
    is that there are no "true" / "false" constants so "1" and
    "0" are still rendered here.
