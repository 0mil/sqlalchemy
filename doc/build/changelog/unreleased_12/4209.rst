    Fixed 1.2 regression where a mapper option that contains an
    :class:`.AliasedClass` object, as is typical when using the
    :meth:`.QueryableAttribute.of_type` method, could not be pickled.   1.1's
    behavior was to omit the aliased class objects from the path, so this
    behavior is restored.
