    Fixed bug where the declarative scan for attributes would receive the
    expression proxy delivered by a hybrid attribute at the class level, and
    not the hybrid attribute itself, when receiving the descriptor via the
    ``@declared_attr`` callable on a subclass of an already-mapped class. This
    would lead to an attribute that did not report itself as a hybrid when
    viewed within :attr:`.Mapper.all_orm_descriptors`.
