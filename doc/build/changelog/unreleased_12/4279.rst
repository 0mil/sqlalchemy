    Fixed regression in 1.2 due to :ticket:`4147` where a :class:`.Table` that
    has had some of its indexed columns redefined with new ones, as would occur
    when overriding columns during reflection or when using
    :paramref:`.Table.extend_existing`, such that the :meth:`.Table.tometadata`
    method would fail when attempting to copy those indexes as they still
    referred to the replaced column.   The copy logic now accommodates for this
    condition.
