    Removed a warning that would be emitted when calling upon
    ``__table_args__``, ``__mapper_args__`` as named with a ``@declared_attr``
    method, when called from a non-mapped declarative mixin.  Calling these
    directly is documented as the approach to use when one is overidding one
    of these methods on a mapped class.  The warning still emits for regular
    attribute names.
