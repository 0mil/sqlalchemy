    Fixed issue in :class:`.ARRAY` datatype which is essentially the same
    issue as that of :ticket:`3832`, except not a regression, where
    column attachment events on top of :class:`.ARRAY` would not fire
    correctly, thus interfering with systems which rely upon this.   A key
    use case that was broken by this is the use of mixins to declare
    columns that make use of :meth:`.MutableList.as_mutable`.
