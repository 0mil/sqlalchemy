    Fixed bug in MySQLdb dialect and variants such as PyMySQL where an
    additional "unicode returns" check upon connection makes explicit use of
    the "utf8" character set, which in MySQL 8.0 emits a warning that utf8mb4
    should be used.  This is now replaced with a utf8mb4 equivalent.
    Documentation is also updated for the MySQL dialect to specify utf8mb4 in
    all examples.  Additional changes have been made to the test suite to use
    utf8mb3 charsets and databases (there seem to be collation issues in some
    edge cases with utf8mb4), and to support configuration default changes made
    in MySQL 8.0 such as explicit_defaults_for_timestamp as well as new errors
    raised for invalid MyISAM indexes.
