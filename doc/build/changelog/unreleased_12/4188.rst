    Fixed bug in concrete inheritance mapping where user-defined
    attributes such as hybrid properties that mirror the names
    of mapped attributes from sibling classes would be overwritten by
    the mapper as non-accessible at the instance level.   Additionally
    ensured that user-bound descriptors are not implicitly invoked at the class
    level during the mapper configuration stage.
