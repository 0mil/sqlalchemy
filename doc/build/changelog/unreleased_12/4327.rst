    Fixed 1.2 regression caused by :ticket:`3472` where the handling of an
    "updated_at" style column within the context of a post-update operation
    would also occur for a row that is to be deleted following the update,
    meaning both that a column with a Python-side value generator would show
    the now-deleted value that was emitted for the UPDATE before the DELETE
    (which was not the previous behavor), as well as that a SQL- emitted value
    generator would have the attribute expired, meaning the previous value
    would be unreachable due to the row having been deleted and the object
    detached from the session.The "postfetch" logic that was added as part of
    :ticket:`3472` is now skipped entirely for an object that ultimately is to
    be deleted.
