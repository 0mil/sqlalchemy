	Fixed a race condition which could occur if automap
	:meth:`.AutomapBase.prepare` were used within a multi-threaded context
	against other threads which  may call :func:`.configure_mappers` as a
	result of use of other mappers.  The unfinished mapping work of automap
	is particularly sensitive to being pulled in by a
	:func:`.configure_mappers` step leading to errors.
