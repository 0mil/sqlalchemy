    Added a new method :meth:`.DefaultExecutionContext.get_current_parameters`
    which is used within a function-based default value generator in
    order to retrieve the current parameters being passed to the statement.
    The new function differs from the
    :attr:`.DefaultExecutionContext.current_parameters` attribute in
    that it also provides for optional grouping of parameters that
    correspond to a multi-valued "insert" construct.  Previously it was not
    possible to identify the subset of parameters that were relevant to
    the function call.
