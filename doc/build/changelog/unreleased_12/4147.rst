    Fixed bug where the :meth:`.Table.tometadata` method would not properly
    accommodate :class:`.Index` objects that didn't consist of simple
    column expressions, such as indexes against a :func:`.text` construct,
    indexes that used SQL expressions or :attr:`.func`, etc.   The routine
    now copies expressions fully to a new :class:`.Index` object while
    substituting all table-bound :class:`.Column` objects for those
    of the target table.
