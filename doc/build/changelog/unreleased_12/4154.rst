    Fixed regression in 1.2 where newly repaired quoting
    of collation names in :ticket:`3785` breaks SQL Server,
    which explicitly does not understand a quoted collation
    name.   Whether or not mixed-case collation names are
    quoted or not is now deferred down to a dialect-level
    decision so that each dialect can prepare these identifiers
    directly.
