    Added a new class of "rowcount support" for dialects that is specific to
    when "RETURNING", which on SQL Server looks like "OUTPUT inserted", is in
    use, as the PyODBC backend isn't able to give us rowcount on an UPDATE or
    DELETE statement when OUTPUT is in effect.  This primarily affects the ORM
    when a flush is updating a row that contains server-calcluated values,
    raising an error if the backend does not return the expected row count.
    PyODBC now states that it supports rowcount except if OUTPUT.inserted is
    present, which is taken into account by the ORM during a flush as to
    whether it will look for a rowcount.
