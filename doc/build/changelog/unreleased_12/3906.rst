    Added support for :class:`.Enum` to persist the values of the enumeration,
    rather than the keys, when using a Python pep-435 style enumerated object.
    The user supplies a callable function that will return the string values to
    be persisted.  This allows enumerations against non-string values to be
    value-persistable as well.  Pull request courtesy Jon Snyder.
