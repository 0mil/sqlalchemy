    Made some adjustments to :class:`.Pool` and :class:`.Connection` such
    that recovery logic is not run underneath exception catches for
    ``pool.Empty``, ``AttributeError``, since when the recovery operation
    itself fails, Python 3 creates a misleading stack trace referring to the
    ``Empty`` / ``AttributeError`` as the cause, when in fact these exception
    catches are part of control flow.
