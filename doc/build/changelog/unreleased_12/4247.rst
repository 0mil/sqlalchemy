	The horizontal sharding extension now makes use of the identity token
	added to ORM identity keys as part of :ticket:`4137`, when an object
	refresh or column-based deferred load or unexpiration operation occurs.
	Since we know the "shard" that the object originated from, we make
	use of this value when refreshing, thereby avoiding queries against
	other shards that don't match this object's identity in any case.
