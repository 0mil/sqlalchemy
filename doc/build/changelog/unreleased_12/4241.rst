    Fixed issue in single-inheritance loading where the use of an aliased
    entity against a single-inheritance subclass in conjunction with the
    :meth:`.Query.select_from` method would cause the SQL to be rendered with
    the unaliased table mixed in to the query, causing a cartesian product.  In
    particular this was affecting the new "selectin" loader when used against a
    single-inheritance subclass.
