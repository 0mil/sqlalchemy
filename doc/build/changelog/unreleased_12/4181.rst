    Fixed bug where events associated with an :class:`Engine`
    at the class level would be doubled when the
    :meth:`.Engine.execution_options` method were used.  To
    achieve this, the semi-private class :class:`.OptionEngine`
    no longer accepts events directly at the class level
    and will raise an error; the class only propagates class-level
    events from its parent :class:`.Engine`.   Instance-level
    events continue to work as before.
