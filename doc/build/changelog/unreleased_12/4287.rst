    Fixed bug in cache key generation for baked queries which could cause a
    too-short cache key to be generated for the case of eager loads across
    subclasses.  This could in turn cause the eagerload query to be cached in
    place of a non-eagerload query, or vice versa, for a polymorhic "selectin"
    load, or possibly for lazy loads or selectin loads as well.
