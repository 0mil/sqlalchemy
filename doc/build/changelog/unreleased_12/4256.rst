	Fixed regression in 1.2.7 caused by :ticket:`4228`, which itself was fixing
	a 1.2-level regression, where the ``query_cls`` callable passed to a
	:class:`.Session` was assumed to be a subclass of :class:`.Query`  with
	class method availability, as opposed to an arbitrary callable.    In
	particular, the dogpile caching example illustrates ``query_cls`` as a
	function and not a :class:`.Query` subclass.
