    Internal refinements to the :class:`.Enum`, :class:`.Interval`, and
    :class:`.Boolean` types, which now extend a common mixin
    :class:`.Emulated` that indicates a type that provides Python-side
    emulation of a DB native type, switching out to the DB native type when a
    supporting backend is in use.   The Postgresql :class:`.INTERVAL` type
    when used directly will now include the correct type coercion rules for
    SQL expressions that also take effect for :class:`.sqltypes.Interval`
    (such as adding a date to an interval yields a datetime).
