   Fixed bug where the SQL Server "IDENTITY_INSERT" logic that allows an INSERT
   to proceed with an explicit value on an IDENTITY column was not detecting
   the case where :meth:`.Insert.values` were used with a dictionary that
   contained a :class:`.Column` as key and a SQL expression as a value.
