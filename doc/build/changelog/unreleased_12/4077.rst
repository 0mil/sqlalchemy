    Added ``__next__()`` and ``next()`` methods to :class:`.ResultProxy`,
    so that the ``next()`` builtin function works on the object directly.
    :class:`.ResultProxy` has long had an ``__iter__()`` method which already
    allows it to respond to the ``iter()`` builtin.   The implementation
    for ``__iter__()`` is unchanged, as performance testing has indicated
    that iteration using a ``__next__()`` method with ``StopIteration``
    is about 20% slower in both Python 2.7 and 3.6.
