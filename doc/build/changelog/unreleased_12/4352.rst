   The column conflict resolution technique discussed at
   :ref:`declarative_column_conflicts` is now functional for a :class:`.Column`
   that is also a primary key column.  Previously, a check for primary key
   columns declared on a single-inheritance subclass would occur before the
   column copy were allowed to pass.
