    Fixed bug where a :class:`.Sequence` would be dropped explicitly before any
    :class:`.Table` that refers to it, which breaks in the case when the
    sequence is also involved in a server-side default for that table, when
    using :meth:`.MetaData.drop_all`.   The step which processes sequences
    to be dropped via non server-side column default functions is now invoked
    after the table itself is dropped.
