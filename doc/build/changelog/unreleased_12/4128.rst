    Fixed a long-standing regression that occurred in version
    1.0, which prevented the use of a custom :class:`.MapperOption`
    that alters the _params of a :class:`.Query` object for a
    lazy load, since the lazy loader itself would overwrite those
    parameters.   This applies to the "temporal range" example
    on the wiki.  Note however that the
    :meth:`.Query.populate_existing` method is now required in
    order to rewrite the mapper options associated with an object
    already loaded in the identity map.

    As part of this change, a custom defined
    :class:`.MapperOption` will now cause lazy loaders related to
    the target object to use a non-baked query by default unless
    the :meth:`.MapperOption._generate_cache_key` method is implemented.
    In particular, this repairs one regression which occured when
    using the dogpile.cache "advanced" example, which was not
    returning cached results and instead emitting SQL due to an
    incompatibility with the baked query loader; with the change,
    the ``RelationshipCache`` option included for many releases
    in the dogpile example will disable the "baked" query altogether.
    Note that the dogpile example is also modernized to avoid both
    of these issues as part of issue :ticket:`4258`.
