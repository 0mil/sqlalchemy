    Fixed a long-standing regression that occurred in version
    1.0, which prevented the use of a custom :class:`.MapperOption`
    that alters the _params of a :class:`.Query` object for a
    lazy load, since the lazy loader itself would overwrite those
    parameters.   This applies to the "temporal range" example
    on the wiki.  Note however that the
    :meth:`.Query.populate_existing` method is now required in
    order to rewrite the mapper options associated with an object
    already loaded in the identity map.  Also, a custom defined
    :class:`.MapperOption` will now cause lazy loaders related to
    the target object to use a non-baked query by default unless
    the :meth:`.MapperOption._generate_cache_key` method is implemented.
