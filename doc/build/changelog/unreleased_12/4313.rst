    Fixed bug where the multi-table support for UPDATE and DELETE statements
    did not consider the additional FROM elements as targets for correlation,
    when a correlated SELECT were also combined with the statement.  This
    change now includes that a SELECT statement in the WHERE clause for such a
    statement will try to auto-correlate back to these additional tables in the
    parent UPDATE/DELETE or unconditionally correlate if
    :meth:`.Select.correlate` is used.  Note that auto-correlation raises an
    error if the SELECT statement would have no FROM clauses as a result, which
    can now occur if the parent UPDATE/DELETE specifies the same tables in its
    additional set of tables; specify :meth:`.Select.correlate` explicitly to
    resolve.
