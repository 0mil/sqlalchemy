    Added a new data member to the identity key tuple
    used by the ORM's identity map, known as the
    "identity_token".  This token defaults to None but
    may be used by database sharding schemes to differentiate
    objects in memory with the same primary key that come
    from different databases.   The horizontal sharding
    extension integrates this token applying the shard
    identifier to it, thus allowing primary keys to be
    duplicated across horizontally sharded backends.
