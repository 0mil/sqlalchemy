    Fixed bug where use of :class:`.Lateral` construct in conjunction with
    :meth:`.Query.join` as well as :meth:`.Query.select_entity_from` would not
    apply clause adaption to the right side of the join.   "lateral" introduces
    the use case of the right side of a join being correlatable.  Previously,
    adaptation of this clause wasn't considered.   Note that in 1.2 only,
    a selectable introduced by :meth:`.Query.subquery` is still not adapted
    due to :ticket:`4304`; the selectable needs to be produced by the
    :func:`.select` function to be the right side of the "lateral" join.
