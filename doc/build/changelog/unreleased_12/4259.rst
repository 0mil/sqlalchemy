    Altered the Oracle dialect such that when an :class:`.Integer` type is in
    use, the cx_Oracle.NUMERIC type is set up for setinputsizes().  In
    SQLAlchemy 1.1 and earlier, cx_Oracle.NUMERIC was passed for all numeric
    types unconditionally, and in 1.2 this was removed to allow for better
    numeric precision.  However, for integers, some database/client setups
    will fail to coerce boolean values True/False into integers which introduces
    regressive behavior when using SQLAlchemy 1.2.  Overall, the setinputsizes
    logic seems like it will need a lot more flexibility going forward so this
    is a start for that.
