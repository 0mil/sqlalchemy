    Fixed issue that is closely related to :ticket:`3639` where an expression
    rendered in a boolean context on a non-native boolean backend would
    be compared to 1/0 even though it is already an implcitly boolean
    expression, when :meth:`.ColumnElement.self_group` were used.  While this
    does not affect the user-friendly backends (MySQL, SQLite) it was not
    handled by Oracle (and possibly SQL Server).   Whether or not the
    expression is implicitly boolean on any database is now determined
    up front as an additional check to not generate the integer comparison
    within the compliation of the statement.
