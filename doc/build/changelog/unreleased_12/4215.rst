    Fixed bug where using :meth:`.Mutable.associate_with` or
    :meth:`.Mutable.as_mutable` in conjunction with a class that has non-
    primary mappers set up with alternatively-named attributes would produce an
    attribute error.  Since non-primary mappers are not used for persistence,
    the mutable extension now excludes non-primary mappers from its
    instrumentation steps.
