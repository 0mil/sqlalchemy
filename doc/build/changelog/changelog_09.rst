.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.0

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2715

        Added another conditional to the ``mysql+gaerdbms`` dialect to
        detect so-called "development" mode, where we should use the
        ``rdbms_mysqldb`` DBAPI.  Patch courtesy Brett Slatkin.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mysql
        :tickets: 2704

        The ``mysql_length`` parameter used with :class:`.Index` can now
        be passed as a dictionary of column names/lengths, for use
        with composite indexes.  Big thanks to Roman Podolyaka for the
        patch.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, ext, associationproxy
        :tickets: 2751

        Added additional criterion to the ==, != comparators, used with
        scalar values, for comparisons to None to also take into account
        the association record itself being non-present, in addition to the
        existing test for the scalar endpoint on the association record
        being NULL.  Previously, comparing ``Cls.scalar == None`` would return
        records for which ``Cls.associated`` were present and
        ``Cls.associated.scalar`` is None, but not rows for which
        ``Cls.associated`` is non-present.  More significantly, the
        inverse operation ``Cls.scalar != None`` *would* return ``Cls``
        rows for which ``Cls.associated`` was non-present.

        The case for ``Cls.scalar != 'somevalue'`` is also modified
        to act more like a direct SQL comparison; only rows for
        which ``Cls.associated`` is present and ``Associated.scalar``
        is non-NULL and not equal to ``'somevalue'`` are returned.
        Previously, this would be a simple ``NOT EXISTS``.

        Also added a special use case where you
        can call ``Cls.scalar.has()`` with no arguments,
        when ``Cls.scalar`` is a column-based value - this returns whether or
        not ``Cls.associated`` has any rows present, regardless of whether
        or not ``Cls.associated.scalar`` is NULL or not.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2369

        Fixed an obscure bug where the wrong results would be
        fetched when joining/joinedloading across a many-to-many
        relationship to a single-table-inheriting
        subclass with a specific discriminator value, due to "secondary"
        rows that would come back.  The "secondary" and right-side
        tables are now inner joined inside of parenthesis for all
        ORM joins on many-to-many relationships so that the left->right
        join can accurately filtered.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 2747

        When querying the information schema on SQL Server 2000, removed
        a CAST call that was added in 0.8.1 to help with driver issues,
        which apparently is not compatible on 2000.
        The CAST remains in place for SQL Server 2005 and greater.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2721

        The ``deferrable`` keyword argument on :class:`.ForeignKey` and
        :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` will not render the ``DEFERRABLE`` keyword
        on the MySQL dialect.  For a long time we left this in place because
        a non-deferrable foreign key would act very differently than a deferrable
        one, but some environments just disable FKs on MySQL, so we'll be less
        opinionated here.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, ext, orm
        :tickets: 2730

        Fixed bug where :class:`.MutableDict` didn't report a change event
        when ``clear()`` was called.  Also in 0.8.2

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2738

        Fixed bug whereby joining a select() of a table "A" with multiple
        foreign key paths to a table "B", to that table "B", would fail
        to produce the "ambiguous join condition" error that would be
        reported if you join table "A" directly to "B"; it would instead
        produce a join condition with multiple criteria.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql, reflection
        :tickets: 2728

        Fixed bug whereby using :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` across a remote
        schema as well as a local schema could produce wrong results
        in the case where both schemas had a table of the same name.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2726

        Removed the "not implemented" ``__iter__()`` call from the base
        :class:`.ColumnOperators` class, while this was introduced
        in 0.8.0 to prevent an endless, memory-growing loop when one also
        implements a ``__getitem__()`` method on a custom
        operator and then calls erroneously ``list()`` on that object,
        it had the effect of causing column elements to report that they
        were in fact iterable types which then throw an error when you try
        to iterate.   There's no real way to have both sides here so we
        stick with Python best practices.  Careful with implementing
        ``__getitem__()`` on your custom operators! Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 1068

        A :class:`.Label` construct will now render as its name alone
        in an ``ORDER BY`` clause, if that label is also referred to
        in the columns clause of the select, instead of rewriting the
        full expression.  This gives the database a better chance to
        optimize the evaulation of the same expression in two different
        contexts.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, firebird
        :tickets: 2504

        The ``fdb`` dialect is now the default dialect when
        specified without a dialect qualifier, i.e. ``firebird://``,
        per the Firebird project publishing ``fdb`` as their
        official Python driver.

    .. change::
    	:tags: feature, general
      	:tickets: 2671

        The codebase is now "in-place" for Python
        2 and 3, the need to run 2to3 has been removed.
        Compatibility is now against Python 2.6 on forward.

    .. change::
    	:tags: feature, oracle, py3k

    	The Oracle unit tests with cx_oracle now pass
    	fully under Python 3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2736

        The "auto-aliasing" behavior of the :class:`.Query.select_from`
        method has been turned off.  The specific behavior is now
        availble via a new method :class:`.Query.select_entity_from`.
        The auto-aliasing behavior here was never well documented and
        is generally not what's desired, as :class:`.Query.select_from`
        has become more oriented towards controlling how a JOIN is
        rendered.  :class:`.Query.select_entity_from` will also be made
        available in 0.8 so that applications which rely on the auto-aliasing
        can shift their applications to use this method.
