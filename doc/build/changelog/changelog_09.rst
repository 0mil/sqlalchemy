.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.0

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, firebird
        :tickets: 2504

        The ``fdb`` dialect is now the default dialect when
        specified without a dialect qualifier, i.e. ``firebird://``,
        per the Firebird project publishing ``fdb`` as their
        official Python driver.

    .. change::
    	:tags: feature, general
      	:tickets: 2671

		The codebase is now "in-place" for Python
		2 and 3, the need to run 2to3 has been removed.
		Compatibility is now against Python 2.6 on forward.

    .. change::
    	:tags: feature, oracle, py3k

    	The Oracle unit tests with cx_oracle now pass
    	fully under Python 3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2736

        The "auto-aliasing" behavior of the :class:`.Query.select_from`
        method has been turned off.  The specific behavior is now
        availble via a new method :class:`.Query.select_entity_from`.
        The auto-aliasing behavior here was never well documented and
        is generally not what's desired, as :class:`.Query.select_from`
        has become more oriented towards controlling how a JOIN is
        rendered.  :class:`.Query.select_entity_from` will also be made
        available in 0.8 so that applications which rely on the auto-aliasing
        can shift their applications to use this method.
