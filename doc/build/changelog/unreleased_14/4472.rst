    Added the ability to add arbitrary criteria to the ON clause generated
    by a relationship attribute in a query, which applies to methods such
    as :meth:`_query.Query.join` as well as loader options like
    :func:`_orm.joinedload`.   Additionally, a "global" version of the option
    allows limiting criteria to be applied to particular entities in
    a query globally.

    .. TODO: add links to new examples section and session-related
       documentation involving do_orm_execute event when merged
