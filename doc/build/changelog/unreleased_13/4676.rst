    Fixed regression in new relationship m2o comparison logic first introduced
    at :ref:`change_4359` when comparing to an attribute that is persisted as
    NULL and is in an un-fetched state in the mapped instance.  Since the
    attribute has no explicit default, it needs to default to NULL when
    accessed in a persistent setting.
