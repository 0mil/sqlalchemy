    Ensured that the "pyproject.toml" file is not included in builds, as the
    presence of this file is a positive direction to pip that pep-517 should be
    used. As this mode of operation is not well supported by current tools /
    distros, we would like to explicitly disallow this mode of operation until
    we have an actual pep517 installation module available.
