    Revised the approach for the just added support for the psycopg2
    "execute_values()" feature added in 1.3.7 for :ticket:`4623`.  The approach
    relied upon a regular expression that would fail to match for a more
    complex INSERT statement such as one which had subqueries involved.   The
    new approach matches exactly the string that was rendered as the VALUES
    clause.
