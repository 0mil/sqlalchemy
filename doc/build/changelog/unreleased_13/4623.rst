    Added new dialect flag for the psycopg2 dialect, ``executemany_mode`` which
    supersedes the previous experimental ``use_batch_mode`` flag.
    ``executemany_mode`` supports both the "execute batch" and "execute values"
    functions provided by psycopg2, the latter which is used for compiled
    :func:`.insert` constructs.   Pull request courtesy Yuval Dinari.
