    Fixed bug where the :attr:`.Mapper.all_orm_descriptors` accessor would
    return an entry for the :class:`.Mapper` itself under the declarative
    ``__mapper___`` key, when this is not a descriptor.  The ``.is_attribute``
    flag that's present on all :class:`.InspectionAttr` objects is now
    consulted, which has also been modified to be ``True`` for an association
    proxy, as it was erroneously set to False for this object.
