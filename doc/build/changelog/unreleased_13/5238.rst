    The string argument accepted as the first positional argument by the
    :func:`.relationship` function when using the Declarative API is no longer
    interpreted using the Python ``eval()`` function; instead, the name is dot
    separated and the names are looked up directly in the name resolution
    dictionary without treating the value as a Python expression.  However,
    passing a string argument to the other :func:`.relationship` parameters
    that necessarily must accept Python expressions will still use ``eval()``;
    the documentation has been clarified to ensure that there is no ambiguity
    that this is in use.
