    Fixed regression in Oracle dialect that was inadvertently using max
    identifier length of 128 characters on Oracle server 12.2 and greater even
    though the stated contract for the remainder of the 1.3 series is  that
    this value stays at 30 until version SQLAlchemy 1.4.  Also repaired issues
    with the retrieval of the "compatibility" version, and removed the warning
    emitted when the "v$parameter" view was not accessible as this was  causing
    user confusion.
