    Added support for reflection of CHECK constraints that include the special
    PostgreSQL qualifier "NOT VALID", which can be present for CHECK
    constraints that were added to an exsiting table with the directive that
    they not be applied to existing data in the table. The PostgreSQL
    dictionary for CHECK constraints as returned by
    :meth:`.Inspector.get_check_constraints` may include an additional entry
    ``dialect_options`` which within will contain an entry ``"not_valid":
    True`` if this symbol is detected.   Pull request courtesy Bill Finn.
