    Fixed bug where usage of "PRAGMA table_info" in SQLite dialect meant that
    reflection features to detect for table existence, list of table columns,
    and list of foreign keys, would default to any table in any attached
    database, when no schema name was given and the table did not exist in the
    base schema.  The fix explicitly runs PRAGMA for the 'main' schema and then
    the 'temp' schema if the 'main' returned no rows, to maintain the behavior
    of tables + temp tables in the "no schema" namespace, attached tables only
    in the "schema" namespace.
