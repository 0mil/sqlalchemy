    Added support for parameter-less connection URLs for the psycopg2 dialect,
    meaning, the URL can be passed to :func:`.create_engine` as
    ``"postgresql+psycopg2://"`` with no additional arguments to indicate an
    empty DSN passed to libpq, which indicates to connect to "localhost" with
    no username, password, or database given. Pull request courtesy Julian
