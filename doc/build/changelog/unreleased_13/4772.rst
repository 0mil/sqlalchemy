    Fixed bug where a many-to-one relationship that specified ``uselist=True``
    would fail to update correctly during a primary key change where a related
    column needs to change.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, orm
    :tickets: 4772

    Fixed bug where the detection for many-to-one or one-to-one use with a
    "dynamic" relationship, which is an invalid configuration, would fail to
    raise if the relationship were configured with ``uselist=True``.  The
    current fix is that it warns, instead of raises, as this would otherwise be
    backwards incompatible, however in a future release it will be a raise.
