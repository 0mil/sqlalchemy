    Modified the internal "identity set" implementation, which is a set that
    hashes objects on their id() rather than their hash values, to not actually
    call the ``__hash__()`` method of the objects, which are typically
    user-mapped objects.  Some methods were calling this method as a side
    effect of the implementation.
