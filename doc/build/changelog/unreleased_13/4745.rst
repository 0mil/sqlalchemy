    Ensured that the queries used to reflect indexes and view definitions will
    explicitly CAST string parameters into NVARCHAR, as many SQL Server drivers
    frequently treat string values, particularly those with non-ascii
    characters or larger string values, as TEXT which often don't compare
    correctly against VARCHAR characters in SQL Server's information schema
    tables for some reason.    These CAST operations already take place for
    reflection queries against SQL Server ``information_schema.`` tables but
    were missing from three additional queries that are against ``sys.``
    tables.
