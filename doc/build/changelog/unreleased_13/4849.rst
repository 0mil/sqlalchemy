    Applied an explicit "cause" to most if not all internally raised exceptions
    that are raised from within an internal exception catch, to avoid
    misleading stacktraces that suggest an error within the handling of an
    exception.  While it would be preferable to suppress the internally caught
    exception in the way that the ``__suppress_context__`` attribute would,
    there does not as yet seem to be a way to do this without suppressing an
    enclosing user constructed context, so for now it exposes the internally
    caught exception as the cause so that full information about the context
    of the error is maintained.
