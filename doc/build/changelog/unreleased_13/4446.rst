   Fixed issue in association proxy due to :ticket:`3423` which caused the use
   of custom :class:`.PropComparator` objects with hybrid attribites, such as
   the one demonstrated in  the ``dictlike-polymorphic`` example to not
   function within an association proxy.  The strictness that was added in
   :ticket:`3423` has been relaxed, and additional logic to accomodate for
   an association proxy that links to a custom hybrid have been added.
