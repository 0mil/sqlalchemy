   :tickets: 4423

   Implemented a new feature whereby the :class:`.AliasedClass` construct can
   now be used as the target of a :func:`.relationship`.  This allows the
   concept of "non primary mappers" to no longer be necessary, as the
   :class:`.AliasedClass` is much easier to configure and automatically inherits
   all the relationships of the mapped class, as well as preserves the
   ability for loader options to work normally.
