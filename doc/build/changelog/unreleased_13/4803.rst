    Fixed bug where using :meth:`.Query.first` or a slice expression in
    conjunction with a query that has an expression based "offset" applied
    would raise TypeError, due to an "or" conditional against "offset" that did
    not expect it to be a SQL expression as opposed to an integer or None.
