    Revised an internal change to the test system added as a result of
    :ticket:`5085` where a testing-related module per dialect would be loaded
    unconditionally upon making use of that dialect, pulling in SQLAlchemy's
    testing framework as well as the ORM into the module import space.   This
    would only impact initial startup time and memory to a modest extent,
    however it's best that these additional modules aren't reverse-dependent on
    straight Core usage.
