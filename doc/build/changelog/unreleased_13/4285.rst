    Added support for the use of an :class:`.Enum` datatype using Python
    pep-435 enumeration objects as values for use as a primary key column
    mapped by the ORM.  As these values are not inherently sortable, as
    required by the ORM for primary keys, a new
    :attr:`.TypeEngine.sort_key_function` attribute is added to the typing
    system which allows any SQL type to  implement a sorting for Python objects
    of its type which is consulted by the unit of work.   The :class:`.Enum`
    type then defines this using the  database value of a given enumeration.
    The sorting scheme can be  also be redefined by passing a callable to the
    :paramref:`.Enum.sort_key_function` parameter.  Pull request courtesy
    Nicolas Caniart.
