   Added new :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_mapper_configured` event.   This
   event complements the other "configure" stage mapper events with a per
   mapper event that receives each :class:`.Mapper` right before its
   configure step, and additionally may be used to prevent or delay the
   configuration of specific :class:`.Mapper` objects using a new
   return value :attr:`.orm.interfaces.EXT_SKIP`.  See the
   documentation link for an example.
