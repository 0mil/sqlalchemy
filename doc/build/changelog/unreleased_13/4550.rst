   Modified the :paramref:`.Select.with_for_update.of` parameter so that if a
   join or other composed selectable is passed, the individual :class:`.Table`
   objects will be filtered from it, allowing one to pass a join() object to
   the parameter, as occurs normally when using joined table inheritance with
   the ORM.  Pull request courtesy Raymond Lu.
