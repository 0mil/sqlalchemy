    Fixed bug where using ``copy.copy()`` or ``copy.deepcopy()`` on
    :class:`.MutableList` would cause the items within the list to be
    duplicated, due to an inconsistency in how Python pickle and copy both make
    use of ``__getstate__()`` and ``__setstate__()`` regarding lists.  In order
    to resolve, a ``__reduce_ex__`` method had to be added to
    :class:`.MutableList`.  In order to maintain backwards compatibility with
    existing pickles based on ``__getstate__()``, the ``__setstate__()`` method
    remains as well; the test suite asserts that pickles made against the old
    version of the class can still be deserialized by the pickle module.
