    Adjusted the error message emitted by :meth:`.Query.join` when a left hand
    side can't be located that the :meth:`.Query.select_from` method is the
    best way to resolve the issue.  Also, within the 1.3 series, used a
    deterministic ordering when determining the FROM clause from a given column
    entity passed to :class:`.Query` so that the same expression is determined
    each time.
