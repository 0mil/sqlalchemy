    :tags: orm, usecase
    :tickets: 5237

    Introduce :paramref:`_orm.relationship.sync_backref` flag in a relationship
    to control if the synchronization events that mutate the in-Python
    attributes are added. This flag is implied in a ``viewonly=True``
    relationship. This supersedes the previous change :ticket:`5149`, which
    warned that ``viewonly=True`` relationship target of a back_populates or
    backref configuration would be disallowed.
