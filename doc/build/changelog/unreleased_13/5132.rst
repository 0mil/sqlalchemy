    Fixed issue where the :class:`.mssql.DATETIMEOFFSET` type would not
    accommodate for the ``None`` value, introduced as part of the series of
    fixes for this type first introduced in :ticket:`4983`, :ticket:`5045`.
    Additionally, added support for passing a backend-specific date formatted
    string through this type, as is typically allowed for date/time types on
    most other DBAPIs.
