    Fixed issue to workaround SQLite's behavior of assigning "numeric" affinity
    to JSON datatypes, first described at :ref:`change_3850`, which returns
    scalar numeric JSON values as a number and not as a string that can be JSON
    deserialized.  The SQLite-specific JSON deserializer now gracefully
    degrades for this case as an exception and bypasses deserialization for
    single numeric values, as from a JSON perspective they are already
    deserialized.
