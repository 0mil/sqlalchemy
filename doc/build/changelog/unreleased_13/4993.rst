    Setting persistence-related flags on :func:`.relationship` while also
    setting viewonly=True will now emit a regular warning, as these flags do
    not make sense for a viewonly=True relationship.   In particular, the
    "cascade" settings have their own warning that is generated based on the
    individual values, such as "delete, delete-orphan", that should not apply
    to a viewonly relationship.   Note however that in the case of "cascade",
    these settings are still erroneously taking effect even though the
    relationship is set up as "viewonly".   In 1.4, all persistence-related
    cascade settings will be disallowed on a viewonly=True relationship in
    order to resolve this issue.
