   Added new naming convention tokens ``column_0N_name``, ``column_0_N_name``,
   etc., which will render the names / keys / labels for all columns referenced
   by a particular constraint in a sequence.  In order to accommodate for the
   length of such a naming convention, the SQL compiler's auto-truncation
   feature now applies itself to constraint names as well, which creates a
   shortened, deterministically generated name for the constraint that will
   apply to a target backend without going over the character limit of that
   backend.

   The change also repairs two other issues.  One is that the  ``column_0_key``
   token wasn't available even though this token was documented, the other was
   that the ``referred_column_0_name`` token would  inadvertently render the
   ``.key`` and not the ``.name`` of the column if these two values were
   different.
