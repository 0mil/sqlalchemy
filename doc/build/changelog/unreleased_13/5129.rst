    Added a new flag :paramref:`.InstanceEvents.restore_load_context` and
    :paramref:`.SessionEvents.restore_load_context` which apply to the
    :meth:`.InstanceEvents.load`, :meth:`.InstanceEvents.refresh`, and
    :meth:`.SessionEvents.loaded_as_persistent` events, which when set will
    restore the "load context" of the object after the event hook has been
    called.  This ensures that the object remains within the "loader context"
    of the load operation that is already ongoing, rather than the object being
    transferred to a new load context due to refresh operations which may have
    occurred in the event. A warning is now emitted when this condition occurs,
    which recommends use of the flag to resolve this case.  The flag is
    "opt-in" so that there is no risk introduced to existing applications.

    The change additionally adds support for the ``raw=True`` flag to
    session lifecycle events.
