    Repaired support for the :class:`.mssql.DATETIMEOFFSET` datatype on PyODBC,
    by adding PyODBC-level result handlers as it does not include native
    support for this datatype.  This includes usage of the Python 3 "timezone"
    tzinfo subclass in order to set up a timezone, which on Python 2 makes
    use of a minimal backport of "timezone" in sqlalchemy.util.
