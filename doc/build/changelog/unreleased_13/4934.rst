    Added accessor :meth:`.Query.is_single_entity` to :class:`.Query`, which
    will indicate if the results returned by this :class:`.Query` will be a
    list of ORM entities, or a tuple of entities or column expressions.
    SQLAlchemy hopes to improve upon the behavior of single entity / tuples in
    future releases such that the behavior would be explicit up front, however
    this attribute should be helpful with the current behavior.  Pull request
