   Improved the behavior of a relationship-bound many-to-one object expression
   such that the retrieval of column values on the related object are now
   resilient against the object being detached from its parent
   :class:`.Session`, even if the attribute has been expired.  New features
   within the :class:`.InstanceState` are used to memoize the last known value
   of a particular column attribute before its expired, so that the expression
   can still evaluate when the object is detached and expired at the same
   time.  Error conditions are also improved using modern attribute state
   features to produce more specific messages as needed.
