    Fixed issue where the "schema_translate_map" feature would not work with a
    PostgreSQL native enumeration type (i.e. :class:`.Enum`,
    :class:`.postgresql.ENUM`) in that while the "CREATE TYPE" statement would
    be emitted with the correct schema, the schema would not be rendered in
    the CREATE TABLE statement at the point at which the enumeration was
    referenced.
