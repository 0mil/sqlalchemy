    The :class:`.BakedQuery` will not cache a query that was modified by a
    :meth:`.QueryEvents.before_compile` event, so that compilation hooks that
    may be applying ad-hoc modifications to queries will take effect on each
    run.  In particular this is helpful for events that modify queries used in
    lazy loading as well as eager loading such as "select in" loading.  In
    order to re-enable caching for a query modified by this event, a new
    flag ``bake_ok`` is added; see :ref:`baked_with_before_compile` for
    details.

    A longer term plan to provide a new form of SQL caching should solve this
    kind of issue more comprehensively.
