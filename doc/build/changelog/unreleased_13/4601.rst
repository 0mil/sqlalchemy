    Fixed regression from release 1.3.2 caused by :ticket:`4562` where a URL
    that contained only a query string and no hostname, such as for the
    purposes of specifying a service file with connection information, would no
    longer be propagated to psycopg2 properly.   The change in :ticket:`4562`
    has been adjusted to further suit psycopg2's exact requirements, which is
    that if there are any connection parameters whatsoever, the "dsn" parameter
    is no longer required, so in this case the query string parameters are
    passed alone.
