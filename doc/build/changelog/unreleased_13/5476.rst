    Fixed issue where the return type for the various RANGE comparison
    operators would itself be the same RANGE type rather than BOOLEAN, which
    would cause an undesirable result in the case that a
    :class:`.TypeDecorator` that defined result-processing behavior were in
    use.  Pull request courtesy Jim Bosch.
