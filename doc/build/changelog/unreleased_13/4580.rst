   Thanks to :ref:`change_3981`, we no longer need to rely on recipes that
   subclass dialect-specific types directly, :class:`.TypeDecorator` can now
   handle all cases.   Additionally, the above change made it slightly less
   likely that a direct subclass of a base SQLAlchemy type would work as
   expected, which could be misleading.  Documentation has been updated to use
   :class:`.TypeDecorator` for these examples including the PostgreSQL
   "ArrayOfEnum" example datatype and direct support for the "subclass a type
   directly" has been removed.
