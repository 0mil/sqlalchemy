   Restored instance-level support for plain Python descriptors, e.g.
   ``@property`` objects, in conjunction with association proxies, in that if
   the proxied object is not within ORM scope at all, it gets classified as
   "ambiguous" but is proxed directly.  For class level access, a basic class
   level``__get__()`` now returns the
   :class:`.AmbiguousAssociationProxyInstance` directly, rather than raising
   its exception, which is the closest approximation to the previous behavior
   that returned the :class:`.AssociationProxy` itself that's possible.  Also
   improved the stringification of these objects to be more descriptive of
   current state.
