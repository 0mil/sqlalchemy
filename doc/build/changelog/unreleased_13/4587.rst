   Fixed issue in SQL Server dialect where if a bound parameter were present in
   an ORDER BY expression that would ultimately not be rendered in the SQL
   Server version of the statement, the parameters would still be part of the
   execution parameters, leading to DBAPI-level errors.  Pull request courtesy
