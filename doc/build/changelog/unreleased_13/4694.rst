    Reworked the attribute mechanics used by :class:`.AliasedClass` to no
    longer rely upon calling ``__getattribute__`` on the MRO of the wrapped
    class, and to instead resolve the attribute normally on the wrapped class
    using getattr(), and then unwrap/adapt that.  This allows a greater range
    of attribute styles on the mapped class including special ``__getattr__()``
    schemes; but it also makes the code simpler and more resilient in general.
