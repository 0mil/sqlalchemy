   Adjusted the :meth:`.Query.filter_by` method to not call :func:`.and()`
   internally against multiple criteria, instead passing it off to
   :meth:`.Query.filter` as a series of criteria, instead of a single criteria.
   This allows :meth:`.Query.filter_by` to defer to :meth:`.Query.filter`'s
   treatment of variable numbers of clauses, including the case where the list
   is empty.  In this case, the :class:`.Query` object will not have a
   ``.whereclause``, which allows subsequent "no whereclause" methods like
   :meth:`.Query.select_from` to behave consistently.
