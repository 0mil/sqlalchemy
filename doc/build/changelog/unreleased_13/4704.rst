    Fixed regression in :meth:`.Query.join` where the ``aliased=True`` flag
    would not properly apply clause adaptation to filter criteria, if a
    previous join were made to the same entity.  This is because the adapters
    were placed in the wrong order.   The order has been reversed so that the
    adapter for the most recent ``aliased=True`` call takes precedence as was
    the case in 1.2 and earlier.  This broke the "elementtree" examples among
    other things.
