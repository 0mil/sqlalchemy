    Repaired a warning in the ORM flush process that was not covered by  test
    coverage when deleting objects that use the "version_id" feature. This
    warning is generally unreachable unless using a dialect that sets the
    "supports_sane_rowcount" flag to False, which  is not typically the case
    however is possible for some MySQL configurations as well as older Firebird
    drivers, and likely some third party dialects.
