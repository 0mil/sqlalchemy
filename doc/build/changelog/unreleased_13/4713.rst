    Fixed an issue where the :meth:`.orm._ORMJoin.join` method, which is a
    not-internally-used ORM-level method that exposes what is normally an
    internal process of :meth:`.Query.join`, did not propagate the ``full`` and
    ``outerjoin`` keyword arguments correctly.  Pull request courtesy Denis
    Kataev.
