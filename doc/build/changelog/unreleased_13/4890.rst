    A warning is emitted for a condition in which the :class:`.Session` may
    implicitly swap an object out of the identity map for another one with the
    same primary key, detaching the old one, which can be an observed result of
    load operations which occur within the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_flush`
    hook.  The warning is intended to notify the user that some special
    condition has caused this to happen and that the previous object may not be
    in the expected state.
