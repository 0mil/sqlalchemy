    Expanded the scope of cursor/connection cleanup when a statement is
    executed to include when the result object fails to be constructed, or an
    after_cursor_execute() event raises an error, or autocommit / autoclose
    fails.  This allows the DBAPI cursor to be cleaned up on failure and for
    connectionless execution allows the connection to be closed out and
    returned to the connection pool, where previously it waiting until garbage
    collection would trigger a pool return.
