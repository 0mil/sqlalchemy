    Fixed bug where using reflection function such as :meth:`.MetaData.reflect`
    with an :class:`.Engine` object that had execution options applied to it
    would fail, as the resulting :class:`.OptionEngine` proxy object failed to
    include a ``.engine`` attribute used within the reflection routines.
