   Added some helper exceptions that invoke when a mapping based on
   :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase`, :class:`.DeferredReflection`, or
   :class:`.AutoMap` is used before the mapping is ready to be used, which
   contain descriptive information on the class, rather than falling through
   into other failure modes that are less informative.
