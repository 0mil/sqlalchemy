    Fixed regression in joined eager loading introduced in 1.3.0b3 via
    :ticket:`4468` where the ability to create a joined option across a
    :func:`.with_polymorphic` into a polymorphic subclass using
    :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.of_type` and then further along regular mapped
    relationships would fail as the polymorphic subclass would not add itself
    to the load path in a way that could be located by the loader strategy.  A
    tweak has been made to resolve this scenario.
