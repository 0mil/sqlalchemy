   Deprecated the use of :class:`.Sequence` with SQL Server in order to affect
   the "start" and "increment" of the IDENTITY value, in favor of new
   parameters ``mssql_identity_start`` and ``mssql_identity_increment`` which
   set these parameters directly.  :class:`.Sequence` will be used to generate
   real ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` DDL with SQL Server in a future release.
