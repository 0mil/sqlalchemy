    Applied a sweep through all included dialects to ensure names that contain
    single or double quotes are properly escaped when querying system tables,
    for all :class:`.Inspector` methods that accept object names as an argument
    (e.g. table names, view names, etc).   SQLite and MSSQL contained two
    quoting issues that were repaired.
