   Improved the behavior of :func:`.orm.with_polymorphic` in conjunction with
   loader options, in particular wildcard operations as well as
   :func:`.orm.load_only`.  The polymorphic object will be more accurately
   targeted so that column-level options on the entity will correctly take
   effect.The issue is a continuation of the same kinds of things fixed in
   :ticket:`4468`.
