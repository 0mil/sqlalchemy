    A function created using :class:`.GenericFunction` can now specify that the
    name of the function should be rendered with or without quotes by assigning
    the :class:`.quoted_name` construct to the .name element of the object.
    Prior to 1.3.4, quoting was never applied to function names, and some
    quoting was introduced in :ticket:`4467` but no means to force quoting for
    a mixed case name was available.  Additionally, the :class:`.quoted_name`
    construct when used as the name will properly register its lowercase name
    in the function registry so that the name continues to be available via the
    ``func.`` registry.
