    Refactored :meth:`.Query.join` to further clarify the individual components
    of structuring the join. This refactor adds the ability for
    :meth:`.Query.join` to determine the most appropriate "left" side of the
    join when there is more than one element in the FROM list or the query is
    against multiple entities.  If more than one FROM/entity matches, an error
    is raised that asks for an ON clause to be specified to resolve the
    ambiguity.  In particular this targets the regression we saw in
    :ticket:`4363` but is also of general use.   The codepaths within
    :meth:`.Query.join` are now easier to follow and the error cases are
    decided more specifically at an earlier point in the operation.
