    A warning is emitted if a primary key value is passed to :meth:`.Query.get`
    that consists of None for all primary key column positions.   Previously,
    passing a single None outside of a tuple would raise a ``TypeError`` and
    passing a composite None (tuple of None values) would silently pass
    through.   The fix now coerces the single None into a tuple where it is
    handled consistently with the other None conditions.  Thanks to Lev
    Izraelit for the help with this.
