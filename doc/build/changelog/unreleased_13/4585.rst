   Fixed behavioral regression as a result of deprecating the "use_threadlocal"
   flag for :class:`.Pool`, where the :class:`.SingletonThreadPool` no longer
   makes use of this option which causes the "rollback on return" logic to take
   place when the same :class:`.Engine` is used multiple times in the context
   of a transaction to connect or implicitly execute, thereby cancelling the
   transaction.   While this is not the recommended way to work with engines
   and connections, it is nonetheless a confusing behavioral change as when
   using :class:`.SingletonThreadPool`, the transaction should stay open
   regardless of what else is done with the same engine in the same thread.
   The ``use_threadlocal`` flag remains deprecated however the
   :class:`.SingletonThreadPool` now implements its own version of the same
   logic.
