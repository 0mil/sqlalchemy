.. change::
    :tags: bug, sql, py3k
    :tickets: 4931

    Changed the ``repr()`` of the :class:`.quoted_name` construct to use
    regular string repr() under Python 3, rather than running it through
    "backslashreplace" escaping, which can be misleading.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, oracle, firebird
    :tickets: 4931

    Modified the approach of "name normalization" for the Oracle and Firebird
    dialects, which converts from the UPPERCASE-as-case-insensitive convention
    of these dialects into lowercase-as-case-insensitive for SQLAlchemy, to not
    automatically apply the :class:`.quoted_name` construct to a name that
    matches itself under upper or lower case conversion, as is the case for
    many non-european characters.   All names used within metadata structures
    are converted to :class:`.quoted_name` objects in any case; the change
    here would only affect the output of some inspection functions.
