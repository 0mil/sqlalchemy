    Fixed issue where the collection of value processors on a
    :class:`.Compiled` object would be mutated when "expanding IN" parameters
    were used with a datatype that has bind value processors; in particular,
    this would mean that when using statement caching and/or baked queries, the
    same compiled._bind_processors collection would be mutated concurrently.
    Since these processors are the same function for a given bind parameter
    namespace every time, there was no actual negative effect of this issue,
    however, the execution of a :class:`.Compiled` object should never be
    causing any changes in its state, especially given that they are intended
    to be thread-safe and reusable once fully constructed.
