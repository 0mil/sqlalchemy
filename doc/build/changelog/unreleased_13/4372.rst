    :tags: bug, orm declarative
    :tickets: 4372

   Added a ``__clause_element__()`` method to :class:`.ColumnProperty` which
   can allow the usage of a not-fully-declared column or deferred attribute in
   a declarative mapped class slightly more friendly when it's used in a
   constraint or other column-oriented scenario within the class declaration,
   though this still can't work in open-ended expressions; prefer to call the
   :attr:`.ColumnProperty.expression` attribute if receiving ``TypeError``.
