    Changed the implementation of fetching CLOB and BLOB objects to use
    cx_Oracle's native implementation which fetches CLOB/BLOB objects inline
    with other result columns, rather than performing a separate fetch. As
    always, this can be disabled by setting auto_convert_lobs to False.

    As part of this change, the behavior of a CLOB that was given a blank
    string on INSERT now returns None on SELECT, which is now consistent with
    that of VARCHAR on Oracle.
