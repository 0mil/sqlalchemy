    Fixed bug in Oracle dialect where indexes that contain the full set of
    primary key columns would be mistaken as the primary key index itself,
    which is omitted, even if there were multiples.  The check has been refined
    to compare the name of the primary key constraint against the index name
    itself, rather than trying to guess based on the columns present in the
    index.
