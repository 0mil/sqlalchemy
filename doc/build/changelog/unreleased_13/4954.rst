    The :paramref:`.relationship.omit_join` flag was not intended to be
    manually set to True, and will now emit a warning when this occurs.  The
    omit_join optimization is detected automatically, and the ``omit_join``
    flag was only intended to disable the optimization in the hypothetical case
    that the optimization may have interfered with correct results, which has
    not been observed with the modern version of this feature.   Setting the
    flag to True when it is not automatically detected may cause the selectin
    load feature to not work correctly when a non-default primary join
    condition is in use.
