    Adjusted the workings of the :meth:`_orm.Mapper.all_orm_descriptors`
    accessor to represent the attributes in the order that they are located in
    a deterministic way, assuming the use of Python 3.6 or higher which
    maintains the sorting order of class attributes based on how they were
    declared.   This sorting is not guaranteed to match the declared order of
    attributes in all cases however; see the method documentation for the exact
    scheme.
