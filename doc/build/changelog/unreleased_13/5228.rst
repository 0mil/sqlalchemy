    Fixed bug in :func:`.orm.selectinload` loading option where two or more
    loaders that represent different relationships with the same string key
    name as referenced from a single :func:`.orm.with_polymorphic` construct
    with multiple subclass mappers would fail to invoke each subqueryload
    separately, instead making use of a single string-based slot that would
    prevent the other loaders from being invoked.
