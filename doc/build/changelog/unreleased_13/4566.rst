   Fixed regression where a new error message that was supposed to raise when
   attempting to link a relationship option to an AliasedClass without using
   :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type` would instead raise an ``AttributeError``.
   Note that in 1.3, it is no longer valid to create an option path from a
   plain mapper relationship to an :class:`.AliasedClass` without using
   :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type`.
