   Implemented a more comprehensive assignment operation (e.g. "bulk replace")
   when using association proxy with sets or dictionaries.  Fixes the problem
   of redundant proxy objects being created to replace the old ones, which
   leads to excessive events and SQL and in the case of unique constraints
   will cause the flush to fail.
