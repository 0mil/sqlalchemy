    The dialects that support json are supposed to take arguments
    ``json_serializer`` and ``json_deserializer`` at the create_engine() level,
    however the SQLite dialect calls them ``_json_serilizer`` and
    ``_json_deserilalizer``.  The names have been corrected, the old names are
    accepted with a change warning, and these parameters are now documented as
    :paramref:`.create_engine.json_serializer` and
    :paramref:`.create_engine.json_deserializer`.
