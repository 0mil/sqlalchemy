   Fixed 1.3 regression in new "ambiguous FROMs" query logic introduced in
   :ref:`change_4365` where a :class:`.Query` that explicitly places an entity
   in the FROM clause with :meth:`.Query.select_from` and also joins to it
   using :meth:`.Query.join` would later cause an "ambiguous FROM" error if
   that entity were used in additional joins, as the entity appears twice in
   the "from" list of the :class:`.Query`.  The fix resolves this ambiguity by
   folding the standalone entity into the join that it's already a part of in
   the same way that ultimately happens when the SELECT statement is rendered.
