    Fixed an unlikely issue where the "corresponding column" routine for unions
    and other :class:`.CompoundSelect` objects could return the wrong column in
    some overlapping column situtations, thus potentially impacting some ORM
    operations when set operations are in use, if the underlying
    :func:`.select` constructs were used previously in other similar kinds of
    routines, due to a cached value not being cleared.
