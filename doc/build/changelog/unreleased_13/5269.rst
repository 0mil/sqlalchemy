    An informative error message is raised when an ORM many-to-one comparison
    is attempted against an object that is not an actual mapped instance.
    Comparisons such as those to scalar subqueries aren't supported;
    generalized comparison with subqueries is better achieved using
    :meth:`~.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.has`.
