    Fixed bug in sqlalchemy.ext.serializer where a unique
    :class:`.BindParameter` object could conflict with itself if it were
    present in the mapping itself, as well as the filter condition of the
    query, as one side would be used against the non-deserialized version and
    the other side would use the deserialized version.  Logic is added to
    :class:`.BindParameter` similar to its "clone" method which will uniquify
    the parameter name upon deserialize so that it doesn't conflict with its
    original.
