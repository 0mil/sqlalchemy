    Fixed bug where a synonym created against a mapped attribute that does not
    exist yet, as is the case when it refers to backref before mappers are
    configured, would raise recursion errors when trying to test for attributes
    on it which ultimately don't exist (as occurs when the classes are run
    through Sphinx autodoc), as the unconfigured state of the synonym would put
    it into an attribute not found loop.
