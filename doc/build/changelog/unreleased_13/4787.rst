    Fixed bug where :meth:`.TypeEngine.column_expression` method would not be
    applied to subsequent SELECT statements inside of a UNION or other
    :class:`.CompoundSelect`, even though the SELECT statements are rendered at
    the topmost level of the statement.   New logic now differentiates between
    rendering the column expression, which is needed for all SELECTs in the
    list, vs. gathering the returned data type for the result row, which is
    needed only for the first SELECT.
