    Fixed bug in :class:`.Inspector` where the cache key generation did not
    take into account arguments passed in the form of tuples, such as the tuple
    of view name styles to return for the PostgreSQL dialect. This would lead
    the inspector to cache too generally for a more specific set of criteria.
    The logic has been adjusted to include every keyword element in the cache,
    as every argument is expected to be appropriate for a cache else the
    caching decorator should be bypassed by the dialect.
