    Fixed issue involving ``lazy="raise"`` strategy where an ORM delete of an
    object would raise for a simple "use-get" style many-to-one relationship
    that had lazy="raise" configured.  This is inconsistent vs. the change
    introduced in 1.3 as part of :ticket:`4353`, where it was established that
    a history operation that does not expect emit SQL should bypass the
    ``lazy="raise"`` check, and instead effectively treat it as
    ``lazy="raise_on_sql"`` for this case.  The fix adjusts the lazy loader
    strategy to not raise for the case where the lazy load was instructed that
    it should not emit SQL if the object were not present.
