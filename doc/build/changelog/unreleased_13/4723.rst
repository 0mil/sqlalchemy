    Fixed a series of related bugs regarding joined table inheritance more than
    two levels deep, in conjunction with modification to primary key values,
    where those primary key columns are also linked together in a foreign key
    relationship as is typical for joined table inheritance.  The intermediary
    table in a  three-level inheritance hierachy will now get its UPDATE if
    only the primary key value has changed and passive_updates=False (e.g.
    foreign key constraints not being enforced), whereas before it would be
    skipped; similarly, with passive_updates=True (e.g. ON UPDATE  CASCADE in
    effect), the third-level table will not receive an UPDATE statement as was
    the case earlier which would fail since CASCADE already modified it.   In a
    related issue, a relationship linked to a three-level inheritance hierarchy
    on the primary key of an intermediary table of a joined-inheritance
    hierarchy will also correctly have its foreign key column updated when the
    parent object's primary key is modified, even if that parent object is a
    subclass of the linked parent class, whereas before these classes would
    not be counted.
