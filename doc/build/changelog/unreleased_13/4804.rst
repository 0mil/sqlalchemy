    The MySQL dialects will emit "SET NAMES" at the start of a connection when
    charset is given to the MySQL driver, to appease an apparent behavior
    observed in MySQL 8.0 that raises a collation error when a UNION includes
    string columns unioned against columns of the form CAST(NULL AS CHAR(..)),
    which is what SQLAlchemy's polymorphic_union function does.   The issue
    seems to have affected PyMySQL for at least a year, however has recently
    appeared as of mysqlclient 1.4.4 based on changes in how this DBAPI creates
    a connection.  As the presence of this directive impacts three separate
    MySQL charset settings which each have intricate effects based on their
    presense,  SQLAlchemy will now emit the directive on new connections to
    ensure correct behavior.
