    Fixed issue in MySQL dialect when connecting to a psuedo-MySQL database
    such as that provided by ProxySQL, the up front check for isolation level
    when it returns no row will not prevent the dialect from continuing to
    connect. A warning is emitted that the isolation level could not be
    detected.
