    Fixed issue where internal cloning of SELECT constructs could lead to a key
    error if the copy of the SELECT changed its state such that its list of
    columns changed.  This was observed to be occurring in some ORM scenarios
    which may be unique to 1.3 and above, so is partially a regression fix.
