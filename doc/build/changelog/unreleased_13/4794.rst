    Fixed issue in event system where using the ``once=True`` flag with
    dynamically generated listener functions would cause event registration of
    future events to fail if those listener functions were garbage collected
    after they were used, due to an assumption that a listened function is
    strongly referenced.  The "once" wrapped is now modified to strongly
    reference the inner function persistently, and documentation is updated
    that using "once" does not imply automatic de-registration of listener
    functions.
