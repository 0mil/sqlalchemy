    A warning is emitted when making use of the :attr:`.MetaData.sorted_tables`
    attribute as well as the :func:`_schema.sort_tables` function, and the
    given tables cannot be correctly sorted due to a cyclic dependency between
    foreign key constraints. In this case, the functions will no longer sort
    the involved tables by foreign key, and a warning will be emitted. Other
    tables that are not part of the cycle will still be returned in dependency
    order. Previously, the sorted_table routines would return a collection that
    would unconditionally omit all foreign keys when a cycle was detected, and
    no warning was emitted.
