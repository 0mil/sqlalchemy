    Fixed a series of quoting issues which all stemmed from the concept of the
    :func:`.literal_column` construct, which when being "proxied" through a
    subquery to be referred towards by a label that matches its text, the label
    would not have quoting rules applied to it, even if the string in the
    :class:`.Label` were set up as a :class:`.quoted_name` construct.  Not
    applying quoting to the text of the :class:`.Label` is a bug because this
    text is strictly a SQL identifier name and not a SQL expression, and the
    string should not have quotes embedded into it already unlike the
    :func:`.literal_column` which it may be applied towards.   The existing
    behavior of a non-labeled :func:`.literal_column` being propagated as is on
    the outside of a subquery is maintained in order to help with manual
    quoting schemes, although it's not clear if valid SQL can be generated for
    such a construct in any case.
