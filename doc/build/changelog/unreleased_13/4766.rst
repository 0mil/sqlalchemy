    Added support for composite (tuple) IN operators with SQLite, by rendering
    the VALUES keyword for this backend.  As other backends such as DB2 are
    known to use the same syntax, the syntax is enabled in the base compiler
    using a dialect-level flag ``tuple_in_values``.   The change also includes
    support for "empty IN tuple" expressions for SQLite when using "in_()"
    between a tuple value and an empty set.
