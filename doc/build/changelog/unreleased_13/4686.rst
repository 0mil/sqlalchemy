    Applied the mapper "configure mutex" against the declarative class mapping
    process, to guard against the race which can occur if mappers are used
    while dynamic module import schemes are still in the process of configuring
    mappers for related classes.  This does not guard against all possible race
    conditions, such as if the concurrent import has not yet encountered the
    dependent classes as of yet, however it guards against as much as possible
    within the SQLAlchemy declarative process.
