    Fixed regression where new association proxy system was still not proxying
    hybrid attributes when they made use of the ``@hybrid_property.expression``
    decorator to return an alternate SQL expression, or when the hybrid
    returned an arbitrary :class:`.PropComparator`, at the expression level.
    This involved futher generalization of the heuristics used to detect the
    type of object being proxied at the level of :class:`.QueryableAttribute`,
    to better detect if the descriptor ultimately serves mapped classes or
    column expressions.
