    Fixed bug where "distinct" keyword passed to :func:`.select` would not
    treat a string value as a "label reference" in the same way that the
    :meth:`.select.distinct` does; it would instead raise unconditionally. This
    keyword argument and the others passed to :func:`.select` will ultimately
    be deprecated for SQLAlchemy 2.0.
