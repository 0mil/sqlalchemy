    Fixed regression in selectinload loader strategy caused by #4775 (released
    in version 1.3.6) where a many-to-one attribute of None would no longer be
    populated by the loader.  While this was usually not noticeable due to the
    lazyloader populating None upon get, it would lead to a detached instance
    error if the object were detached.
