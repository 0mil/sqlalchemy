    Fixed issue in the area of where loader options such as selectinload()
    interact with the baked query system, such that the caching of a query is
    not supposed to occur if the loader options themselves have elements such
    as with_polymorphic() objects in them that currently are not
    cache-compatible.  The baked loader could sometimes not fully invalidate
    itself in these some of these scenarios leading to missed eager loads.
