    Fixed issue where the :class:`_postgresql.ENUM` type would not consult the
    schema translate map when emitting a CREATE TYPE or DROP TYPE during the
    test to see if the type exists or not.  Additionally, repaired an issue
    where if the same enum were encountered multiple times in a single DDL
    sequence, the "check" query would run repeatedly rather than relying upon a
    cached value.
