    Added support for DROP CHECK constraint which is required by MySQL 8.0.16
    to drop a CHECK constraint; MariaDB supports plain DROP CONSTRAINT.  The
    logic distinguishes between the two syntaxes by checking the server version
    string for MariaDB presence.    Alembic migrations has already worked
    around this issue by implementing its own DROP for MySQL / MariaDB CHECK
    constraints, however this change implements it straight in Core so that its
    available for general use.   Pull request courtesy Hannes Hansen.
