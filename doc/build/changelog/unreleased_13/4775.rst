    The optimzation applied to selectin loading in :ticket:`4340` where a JOIN
    is not needed to eagerly load related items is now applied to many-to-one
    relationships as well, so that only the related table is queried for a
    simple join condition.   In this case, the related items are queried
    based on the value of a foreign key column on the parent; if these columns
    are deferred or otherwise not loaded on any of the parent objects in
    the collection, the loader falls back to the JOIN method.
