    Fixed bug where the special logic to render "NULL" for the
    :class:`.TIMESTAMP` datatype when ``nullable=True`` would not work if the
    column's datatype were a :class:`.TypeDecorator` or a :class:`.Variant`.
    The logic now ensures that it unwraps down to the original
    :class:`.TIMESTAMP` so that this special case NULL keyword is correctly
    rendered when requested.
