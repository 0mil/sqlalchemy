    Fixed regression in loader options introduced in 1.3.0b3 via :ticket:`4468`
    where the ability to create a loader option using
    :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type` targeting an aliased entity that is an
    inheriting subclass of the entity which the preceding relationship refers
    to would fail to produce a matching path.   See also :ticket:`5082` fixed
    in this same release which involves a similar kind of issue.
