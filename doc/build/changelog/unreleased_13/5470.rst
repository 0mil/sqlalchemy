    Repaired an issue where the "ORDER BY" clause rendering a label name rather
    than a complete expression, which is particularly important for SQL Server,
    would fail to occur if the expression were enclosed in a parenthesized
    grouping in some cases.   This case has been added to test support. The
    change additionally adjusts the "automatically add ORDER BY columns when
    DISTINCT is present" behavior of ORM query, deprecated in 1.4, to more
    accurately detect column expressions that are already present.
