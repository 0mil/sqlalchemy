    Fixed bug where usage of joined eager loading would not properly wrap the
    query inside of a subquery when :meth:`.Query.group_by` were used against
    the query.   When any kind of result-limiting approach is used, such as
    DISTINCT, LIMIT, OFFSET, joined eager loading embeds the row-limited query
    inside of a subquery so that the collection results are not impacted.   For
    some reason, the presence of GROUP BY was never included in this criterion,
    even though it has a similar effect as using DISTINCT.   Additionally, the
    bug would prevent using GROUP BY at all for a joined eager load query for
    most database platforms which forbid non-aggregated, non-grouped columns
    from being in the query, as the additional columns for the joined eager
    load would not be accepted by the database.
