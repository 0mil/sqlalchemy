    Added another fix for an upstream MySQL 8 issue where a case sensitive
    table name is reported incorrectly in foreign key constraint reflection,
    this is an extension of the fix first added for :ticket:`4344` which
    affects a case sensitive column name.  The new issue occurs through MySQL
    8.0.17, so the general logic of the 88718 fix remains in place.
