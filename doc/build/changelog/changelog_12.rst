        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 3932

        The cx_Oracle dialect now supports "sane multi rowcount", that is,
        when a series of parameter sets are executed via DBAPI
        ``cursor.executemany()``, we can make use of ``cursor.rowcount`` to
        verify the number of rows matched.  This has an impact within the
        ORM when detecting concurrent modification scenarios, in that
        some simple conditions can now be detected even when the ORM
        is batching statements, as well as when the more strict versioning
        feature is used, the ORM can still use statement batching.  The
        flag is enabled for cx_Oracle assuming at least version 5.0, which
        is now commonplace.

    .. change:: 3276
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 3276

        Oracle reflection now "normalizes" the name given to a foreign key
        constraint, that is, returns it as all lower case for a case
        insensitive name.  This was already the behavior for indexes
        and primary key constraints as well as all table and column names.
        This will allow Alembic autogenerate scripts to compare and render
        foreign key constraint names correctly when initially specified
        as case insensitive.

    .. change:: 2694
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 2694

        Added a new option ``autoescape`` to the "startswith" and
        "endswith" classes of comparators; this supplies an escape character
        also applies it to all occurrences of the wildcard characters "%"
        and "_" automatically.  Pull request courtesy Diana Clarke.
