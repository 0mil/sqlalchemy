    .. change:: 3938
        :tags: bug, engine
        :tickets: 3938

        Fixed bug where in the unusual case of passing a
        :class:`.Compiled` object directly to :meth:`.Connection.execute`,
        the dialect with which the :class:`.Compiled` object were generated
        was not consulted for the paramstyle of the string statement, instead
        assuming it would match the dialect-level paramstyle, causing
        mismatches to occur.

    .. change:: 3918
        :tags: bug, ext
        :tickets: 3918

        Fixed a bug in the ``sqlalchemy.ext.serializer`` extension whereby
        an "annotated" SQL element (as produced by the ORM for many types
        of SQL expressions) could not be reliably serialized.  Also bumped
        the default pickle level for the serializer to "HIGHEST_PROTOCOL".

    .. change:: 3932
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 3932

        The cx_Oracle dialect now supports "sane multi rowcount", that is,
        when a series of parameter sets are executed via DBAPI
        ``cursor.executemany()``, we can make use of ``cursor.rowcount`` to
        verify the number of rows matched.  This has an impact within the
        ORM when detecting concurrent modification scenarios, in that
        some simple conditions can now be detected even when the ORM
        is batching statements, as well as when the more strict versioning
        feature is used, the ORM can still use statement batching.  The
        flag is enabled for cx_Oracle assuming at least version 5.0, which
        is now commonplace.

    .. change:: 3907
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 3907

        The longstanding behavior of the :meth:`.ColumnOperators.in_` and
        :meth:`.ColumnOperators.notin_` operators emitting a warning when
        the right-hand condition is an empty sequence has been revised;
        a simple "static" expression of "1 != 1" or "1 = 1" is now rendered
        by default, rather than pulling in the original left-hand
        expression.  This causes the result for a NULL column comparison
        against an empty set to change from NULL to true/false.  The
        behavior is configurable, and the old behavior can be enabled
        using the :paramref:`.create_engine.empty_in_strategy` parameter
        to :func:`.create_engine`.

    .. change:: 3276
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 3276

        Oracle reflection now "normalizes" the name given to a foreign key
        constraint, that is, returns it as all lower case for a case
        insensitive name.  This was already the behavior for indexes
        and primary key constraints as well as all table and column names.
        This will allow Alembic autogenerate scripts to compare and render
        foreign key constraint names correctly when initially specified
        as case insensitive.

    .. change:: 2694
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 2694

        Added a new option ``autoescape`` to the "startswith" and
        "endswith" classes of comparators; this supplies an escape character
        also applies it to all occurrences of the wildcard characters "%"
        and "_" automatically.  Pull request courtesy Diana Clarke.

    .. change:: 3934
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 3934

        The state of the :class:`.Session` is now present when the
        :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_rollback` event is emitted, that is,  the
        attribute state of objects prior to their being expired.   This is now
        consistent with the  behavior of the
        :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_commit` event which  also emits before the
        attribute state of objects is expired.
